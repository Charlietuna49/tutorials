At the end of [discussion](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#creating-a-website) on how to produce <code>HTML</code> documents from <code>.Rmd</code> the official page of the <code>rmarkdown</code> package mentions that entire website can be produced using R Markdown and the described methodology. 

Creating a website similar to [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](rmarkdown.rstudio.com) can be accomplished using a combination of GitHub Pages and Jekyll (static website generator). The current guide narrates the process of of **publishing a statitic, blog aware website from a GitHub repository** contain multiple **.Rmd** files, united by common attributes in the <code>_output.yaml_</code> file.


## Starting Point

To organize the process of learning new concepts and terminology the reader I started with  [GitHub Pages Help](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles). There is a difference between producing a website for a user or organization, and the a website for a specific project. One can use an  [Automatic Page Generator](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator), but from my understanding so far the limitations of this approach might be substantial.

## Jekyll

1. Ruby  
  - Installation
    - Installing Ruby for Windows using [RubyInstaller](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/#rubyinstaller)
    - version: **Ruby 1.9.3-p545**
    - check **Add Ruby executables to your PATH** box, I checked all
    
  - Developmental Kit
    - tdm-32-4.5.2
    - I unpacked the zip into folder <code>DevKit</code> inside the folder where Ruby was installed.  
    
2. Bundler  
  - Open there local GitHub folder  
  - Initiate command line by typing <code>cmd</code> in the address bar of the File Explorer  
  - type in <code>gem install bundler</code> in the command line  
  - the text should say that the 1 gem has been installed  
  
3. Jekyll  
  - created a text file <code>Gemfile.txt</code> in the root of the repository
  - the content of the file is
```
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
```
  - renamed <code>Gemfile.txt</code> into <code>Gemfile</code>
  - run command line <code>bundle install</code>
  
## GitHub Pages


  - Get to the **gh-pages** branch of the [rmarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/tree/gh-pages) GitHub repository (you should be there anyway)

Into the root of your project's _gh-pages_ branch copy the following:
  - folder **libs** containing style libraries
  - folder **include** containing header and footer for the website
  - file <code>Makefile</code> - clarify the function
  - file <code>_output.yaml</code> - defining the common output options for .Rmd files
  
## Producing the website

At this point the website is a collection of .Rmd files stored in a single repository. Their output attributes are shared and controlled by <code>output.yaml</code> in the root.  To produce the website execute the following steps:

1. Run "produceReports.R" scripts that  prints HTML from all .Rdm files. For example:  

```
path_index<- base::file.path("./index.Rmd")
path_ghPages<- base::file.path("./gh-pages-setup.Rmd")
path_workStation<- base::file.path("./work-station-setup.Rmd")

buildthese<- c(path_index, path_ghPages,path_workStation)

for( pathRmd in buildthese ) {
  rmarkdown::render(input = pathRmd,output_format=c("html_document"), clean=TRUE)
}
```

2. Open command line from the repository's root and execute
```
bunlde exec jekyll serve
```
This will assemble the website and deploy it to the local host. Examine it at
```
localhost:4000
```

3. Commit and sync the changes in the gh-pages branch. The website should become availible at 
```
username.github.io/projectname
```
or a custom address.

To change the website one must repeat these steps after intriducing changes in the initial .Rmd files


## Disqus

1. Register an account with [Disqus](disqus.com) if you haven't already.

2. when logged in go to Settings got Admin area 

3. Click on the drop-down button and select "Add new site"

5. After completing the registration the promt will take you to the page containing code snippets you have to add to your website to enable the comments
  - copy the snippets into appropriate places in the file **./include/after_body.html**
  
6. Re-run the steps 1-3 from the previous subsection. The comments should be enabled now.
