At the end of discussing how to produce <code>HTML</code> documents from <code>.Rmd</code> the official page of the <code>rmarkdown</code> package mentions that entire website can be produced using R Markdown and the described methodology. 

To create a website like [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](rmarkdown.rstudio.com) can be accomplished using a combination of GitHub Pages and Jekyll (static website generator). The current guide narrates the process of preparations needed to **publish a statitic website on GitHub**.


### GitHub Pages Help

To organize the process of learning new concepts and terminology the reader is directed to [GitHub Pages Help](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles). I will be moving through this reference articles in order, installing the components as needed.


#### User & Organization  
  - User - person
  - Organization - lab
  - Project - publication
  
### Creating Pages with the automatic generator
  impressions so far:
  -  limiting:
    - has to go throw creating every time
    - can't figure out how add pages to gh-pages branch
  - clunky
  
  
### Installing Jekyll

1. Ruby
  A. Installation
    - Installing Ruby for Windows using [RubyInstaller](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/#rubyinstaller)
    - version: **Ruby 1.9.3-p545**
    - installation directory: <code>C:\Ruby193</code>
    - check **Add Ruby executables to your PATH** box, I checked all
  B. Developmental Kit
    - tdm-32-4.5.2
    
2. Bundler
  - Open there local GitHub folder
  - Initiate command line by typing <code>cmd</code> in the address bar of the File Explorer
  - type in <code>gem install bundler</code> in the command line
    - the text should say that the 1 gem has been installed
  
3. Jekyll
  - created a text file <code>Gemfile.txt</code> in the root of the repository
  - the content of the file is
```
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
```
  - renamed <code>Gemfile.txt</code> into <code>Gemfile</code>
